# Week3-Project

HOW TO PLAY:
The game is simple, click on the cookie as many times as you can to earn cookies. As you earn more cookies , you'll be able to afford upgrades to increase your cps (cookies per second) the goal is to reach 10 million cookies. There is a music player with a lofi song providing a nice and relaxing user experience(it starts muted so you dont get jumpscared by loud noises).

The shop is powered by the cookie Upgrades API proivided by Tech Educators for this project.

In this weeks project, I have been asked to create a cookie clicker inspired game using the javascript I have learned these past two weeks. Cookie cliker is where the player clicks on a large cookie, earning one cookie per click. With these cookies, the player can buy upgrades such as auto clickers, cookie farms and several more that automatically generate cookies.

In this project , I have completed all base requirements and 2 strecth goals. The stretch goals I managed to achive were adding animations , sound affects and provide clear project descripstion in the read me file.

I had a bit of trouble wondering how to create my buy buttons, I asked around in the class discord to see if I could re jog my memory. I looked back on previous demos and it clicked so I was alright after that. Another problem I was having was my cookie counter wasnt saving in the local storage , turns out I put the updateStorage() function outside of the update loop.

I have really enjoyed this project because I suprised myself with how much javascript I learned these past two weeks. I felt really overwhelmed when trying to learn it same with coding it but when you get into the flow of it all comes back and the knowledge snaps back into your brain! also trello really helped with my planning.

I'd really appresiate some feedback on my code and where i could improve!
